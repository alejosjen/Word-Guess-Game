# [Word-Guess-Game](https://alejosjen.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/)
This project is a simple hangman style game with a theme of guessing the fairy tale the words come from. 

The javascript has code to help split, iterate, and display individual letters. However, that is a good thing, I am stuck on how to stop displaying all of the iterations.

An interesting resource on the hangman style of coding was on YouTube with live coding. I liked a video there, but it didn't solve the problem of displaying repeated letters within a word, thus again, my problem appears again and again.

My name is Jennifer Alejos, I will keep at this, but anyone is welcome to contribute to this project. I'd love to see a menu where we could have multiple Hidden Stories to play and to guess Fairy Tales.

Thanks for reading!
